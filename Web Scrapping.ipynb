    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "There are several methods and tools for web scraping, each with its own advantages and use cases\n",
    "Manual Copy-Pasting:\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Description: The simplest form of web scraping involves manually copying and pasting information from a website into a local file or spreadsheet.\r\n",
    "Use Cases: Suitable for small-scale data extraction when automation is not required or feasible.\r\n",
    "Regular Expressions (Rege):\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Description: Regular expressions can be used to match and extract specific patterns of text from HTML or XML source code.\r\n",
    "Use Cases: Useful for simple text extraction but can become complex and error-prone for handling HTML structure variations.\r\n",
    "HTML Parsing using Libaries:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Description: Use of programming libraries like BeautifulSoup (for Python), jsoup (for Java), or Cheerio (for Node.js) to parse HTML and XML documents and extract specific elements or data.\r\n",
    "Use Cases: Effective for extracting structured data from HTML or XML documents. Provides more flexibility and control compared to regex.."

    "Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "Ans:-Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is commonly used for web scraping purposes. It provides tools for pulling data out of HTML and XML files, making it easy to extract information from web pages. Beautiful Soup creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to navigate and search the HTML or XML structure, making it easier for programmers to extract specific information\n",
    "Why Beautiful Soup is Used:\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Web Scraping: Beautiful Soup is widely used for web scraping tasks. It simplifies the process of extracting data from HTML or XML documents by providing a Pythonic interface for navigating and searching the document's structur.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Data Extraction: It facilitates the extraction of specific information from web pages, making it easy to locate and retrieve data by navigating the HTML or XML structre.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Automation: Beautiful Soup can be used in conjunction with other libraries or tools for automating web scraping tasks. When combined with frameworks like Scrapy or automated browsers like Selenium, it provides a powerful solution for data extraction."

    "Q4. Why is flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "Ans:-Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is commonly used for developing web applications.\n",
    "1.Flask can be used to create a simple web interface that allows users to interact with the web scraping tool. Users can input parameters, initiate the scraping process, and view the results through a web page.\n",
    "2.Flask makes it easy to render HTML templates and display the scraped data in a visually appealing way. This can be especially useful when presenting the results to users who may not be familiar with the intricacies of web scraping or data manipulation.\n",
    "3.If the web scraping project involves multiple users with different levels of access, Flask can be used to implement user authentication and authorization. This ensures that only authorized users can access certain features or data."

    "Q5. Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service.\n",
    "Ans:-In a web scraping project, especially if it involves data storage, processing, and potentially deploying web scraping scripts, various AWS (Amazon Web Services) services can be leveraged.\n",
    "1.Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Use Case: EC2 instances can be used to run web scraping scripts and host the web scraping application. It provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing you to configure virtual servers based on your project's requirements2..\r\n",
    "Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Servic):\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Use Case: S3 can be used to store and manage the scraped data. It is a highly scalable object storage service, allowing you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. You can use S3 to store raw data, processed data, or any other files related to the proj3.ect.\r\n",
    "Amazon RDS (Relational Database Serice):\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Use Case: If your project involves relational databases to store structured data, you can use RDS. It supports multiple database engines, and you can configure and scale a relational database in the cloud 4.easily.\r\n",
    "Amazon DnamoDB:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Use Case: DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service that can be used for storing non-relational data. If your web scraping project deals with unstructured or semi-structured data, DynamoDB might be a suitable choice."
